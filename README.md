#CIRCL Clone

This is a clone of the CIRCL library for Go developed by Cloudlfare. The original can be found here (https://github.com/cloudflare/circl) and was used as part of my Msc thesis where I worked on post-quantum cryptography. However, some of the CIRCL functions need to be exportable to work with the underlying mathematics. This clone was created for that purpose, and I have exported some of the functions in CIRCL to that end. My MSc thesis can be found here (https://github.com/brykumara/CSI-RAShi).
